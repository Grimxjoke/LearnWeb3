# Learn Web 3

This is a repository of part of my journey of learning Web3. In this repository, I am experimenting small projects that are essential parts of the ecosystem.

I'm Learn a lot in Smart Contracts developement, Testing , Tooling and many Security Best Practices to have in this field.

The following projects are included in this repository:

- Delegate Call: Delegate call is a low function use in Solidity. They are usefull for Upgrade Smart Contract but can be a vulnerability in your code if not used correctly

- Flash Loans: Flash Loans are a Innovative Finance usecase when you can borrow millions worth of Cryptocurrencies without providing any collateral whatsoever.

- Private Data: Show Case that Private Data on the Ethereum blockchain are not really Private and can be easily access by any third party.

- Reantrancy Attack: Show Case of one of the most known Vulerability on Smart Contracts when a Hacker Contract keep calling the same function from another Contract before it's finish executing the calling.
