In this Project We are using the AAVE protocol on a fork of the Polygon Mainnet.

## Files

- Go to the `Contract` Folder to see the Smart Contract and the call to the AAVE protocol.
- Go to the `Test` Folder to see how to test it using a Fork of the Polygon Mainnet and how we 'Impersonate' a Big Wallet with the  `hardhat_impersonateAccount` method.

## Testing
